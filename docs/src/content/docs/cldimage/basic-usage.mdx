The CldImage component provides an easy way to deliver images from Cloudinary in an Astro app.

With it comes access to more advanced features like dynamic cropping, background removal, overlays, and other Cloudinary transformations.

As CldImage is a wrapper around the Unpic Image component, you also gain access to built-in Image component features that will work out-of-the-box like [Responsive Sizing](/guides/responsive-images).

## Basic Usage

The basic required props include `width`, `height`, `src`, and `alt`:

<HeaderImage>
  <CldImage
    width="960"
    height="600"
    src={`${import.meta.env.PUBLIC_IMAGES_DIRECTORY}/turtle`}
    sizes="100vw"
    alt="Turtle in the ocean"
  />
</HeaderImage>

<CodeBlock>
  ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
  import { CldImage } from 'astro-cloudinary';

  <CldImage
    width="960"
    height="600"
    src="<Public ID>"
    sizes="100vw"
    alt="Description of my image"
  />
  ```
</CodeBlock>

The `src` property takes in a Cloudinary Public ID which includes the folder path along with the ID of the image itself.
The `width` and the `height` should represent the rendered size and the `alt` value should be a text-based description
of the image.

The `sizes` prop is optional, but recommended for [Responsive Sizing](/guides/responsive-images).

## Transformations

You can further take advantage of Cloudinary features like background removal and overlays by adding additional props:


<HeaderImage>
  <CldImage
    width="500"
    height="500"
    src={`${import.meta.env.PUBLIC_IMAGES_DIRECTORY}/turtle`}
    crop="fill"
    removeBackground
    tint="70:blue:purple"
    underlay={`${import.meta.env.PUBLIC_IMAGES_DIRECTORY}/galaxy`}
    sizes="100vw"
    alt="Turtle in the ocean"
  />
</HeaderImage>

<CodeBlock>
  ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
  import { CldImage } from 'astro-cloudinary';

  <CldImage
    width="500"
    height="500"
    src="<Public ID>"
    crop="fill"
    removeBackground
    tint="70:blue:purple"
    underlay="<Public ID>"
    sizes="100vw"
    alt="Description of my image"
  />
  ```
</CodeBlock>

## Using Cloudinary URLs

CldImage supports passing a fully qualified Cloudinary URL as the `src`, however, it
must include a version number (/v1234) in order to be correctly parsed.

:::tip
The version number is required due to the variable nature of Cloudinary URLs. This helps
to ensure the integretiy when during the parsing process.
:::

<CodeBlock className="mt-6">
  ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
  import { CldImage } from 'astro-cloudinary';

  <CldImage
    width="500"
    height="500"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/v1234/myimage"
    alt="Description of my image"
  />
  ```
</CodeBlock>

### Preserving URL Transformations

If using a full Cloudinary URL, you might already have transformations applied to your image.

To preserve those transformations, you can apply the `preserveTransformations` property:

```jsx copy
<CldImage
  width="600"
  height="600"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/w_100,h_200,c_fill/v1234/myimage"
  preserveTransformations
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```
